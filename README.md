# amazon-image-downloader

**There is a dotnet core port of this app [here](https://github.com/bodzaital/aid-core).**

Displays and downloads a product's images from amazon.com

Enter the URL of the amazon product page, then press Snitch. If you want to change http headers (user agent and accept), then press Settings.
If the image is or over 1500 pixels tall, the app notes it with green text that it might be the largest image. Scroll through the images,
and download the ones you want.
